# Titanic Survival Exploration

## OverView:
This project I have done as a part of my Machine Learning Nanodegree. in this project I have created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. I began with a simple algorithm and increased its complexity until I was able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This Project introduced me to some of the concepts of machine learning as I had start the Nanodegree program.

## Software Requirements:
The project uses following software and ML libraries:
    Python 2.7
    Pandas
    NumPy
    matplotlib

## File Discrption:

This project contains three files:

titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb: This is the main file where I have performed my work on the project.
titanic_data.csv: The project dataset.
visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project.
